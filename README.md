## Deck

### Description

This assignment was the first step in designing a 3-D skateboard in Onshape. I made this part using sketching, extrusions, and fillets.

### Reflection

The one thing I needeed to fix while doing the assignment was when you're creating the holes in the deck you need to dimension it from the center of the board so regardless of the dimensions of the board it will still be the correct distance from the center.

## Trucks 

### Description

The goal of this assignment was to make the trucks for the skateboard. The role of the trucks is to connect the wheels and the deck so this part is very critical. This is made by using extrusions, fillets, and sketches.

### Reflection

Designing this part was tricky if you didn't pay attention to the different types of extrusions for example making sure you add a new extrusion vs just adding it or adding something to the wrong part.

## Wheels and Bearings

### Description

For this assignment we had to design the wheels and bearings for the skateboard. This was made by sketching, revolving, and fillets.

### Reflection

The one thing that can be tricky in this assignment is setting the dimensions. You need to make sure you set the dimensions over the construction line you created so the wheel has the right dimensions. 

## Final Assembly

### Desription

The goal of this assignment was to mate all the parts together and add nuts and bolts. We used the replicate tool.

### Reflection 

The main thing to remember for this assignment is to replicate on a plane. \

## Duck

### Description 

The goal of this assignment was to use the snap tool and the bricks you made in the last assignment to create a 3-D design duck.

### Reflection 

One thing that is importtant to know is how to do the snap mate. I tried to do it after I inserted the brick and not as I inserted the brick which made it much harder.
